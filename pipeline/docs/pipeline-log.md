# Pipeline audit log

Append-only. One line per state transition, written in the same commit as the
`stories.json` change it describes. This is the crash-recovery record: if a run dies,
the last line here plus the story's `status` field tell you exactly where to resume.

Format: `<iso8601> | <story-id> | <transition> | <detail>`
